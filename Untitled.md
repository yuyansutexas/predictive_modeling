# Visual Story Telling Part 1: Green Buildings

Described stats guru would be perfect if the green or not is the only attribute to impact the rent. Based on the question, there are actually confounders for the relationship between rent and green status ---- such as, **size, leasing_rate, stories, age, etc.**. They share the same property , which is that they are different from buildings in the same cluster. On the contrary, variables such as employment growth rate and costs are the same for both green_building and non_green building in the same cluster. Thus, our goal is to predict 

Let's do some quick plots!

We can see the difference is not obvious in class a and b. In class c, the rent of green-building is more than that of non-green building.
